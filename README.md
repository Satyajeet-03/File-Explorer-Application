📌 Objective

Develop a console-based file explorer application in C++ that interfaces with the Linux operating system to perform and manage file and directory operations through system calls.

🚀 Key Features

File & Directory Listing: Display files and subdirectories within a given directory.

Navigation: Move between parent and child directories easily.

File Operations: Perform actions like copy, move, delete, and create.

Search Functionality: Search for files or directories by name.

Permission Management: View and modify file permissions directly from the explorer.

🗓️ Day-Wise Progress

Day 1: Designed the application structure, set up the environment, and implemented basic file listing.
Day 2: Added directory navigation functionality.
Day 3: Implemented file manipulation operations (copy, move, delete, create).
Day 4: Added file search capability within directories.
Day 5: Integrated file permission management for read, write, and execute controls.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Language: C++

Platform: Linux

Core Concepts: File handling, directory traversal (opendir, readdir), system calls, and permission bits.

📂 Outcome

A functional text-based file explorer capable of managing files and directories directly from the terminal, showcasing practical knowledge of Linux system programming and file I/O operations in C++.
